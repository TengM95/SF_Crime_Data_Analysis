# SF_Crime_Data_Analysis

In this project, we processed San Francisco crime data from 2003 to 2018 from San Francisco Police Department https://data.sfgov.org/Public-Safety/Police-Department-Incident-Reports-Historical-2003/tmnf-yvry.

Did data cleaning, data visualization by Spark Dataframe, Spark SQL for big data OLAP.  
Analyzed the distribution of SF crime over category, district, hour, day and month separately.   
Then we used k-means to explore and visualize the spatial distribution of crime over the category and year.
